                    <p>各位，早上好，很高兴能回到这里，很高兴见到你们。我教授这门课是因为，在我读本科阶段时，非常希望能学习这样一门课程，可能这门课并不是你希望的那样，也可能并不适合你。但希望几堂课后，你能有个大概印象，让你决定这门课是否适合你。我1992年来到哈佛求学，大二期间，突然顿悟了，我意识到我身处让人神往大学校园，周围都是出色的同学，优秀的导师，我成绩优异，擅长体育运动，那时壁球打得不错，社交也游刃有余。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Hi Good morning. It’s wonderful to be back here. Wonderful to see you here. I’m teaching this class because I wish a class like this had been taught when I was sitting in your seat as an undergrad here. This does not mean it
                        is a class you wish
                        to be taught, nor does it mean that it is the right class for you. But I hope to doing the next couple of lectures is giving you an idea what this class is about so that you can decide whether or not it is for you. I came
                        here in 1992 And then I
                        had a mini epiphany half way through my sophomore year. I realized that I was in a wonderful place with wonderful students around me, wonderful teachers. I was doing well academically. I was doing well in athletics. I was
                        playing squash at that
                        time. I was doing well socially. Everything was going well.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      一切都很顺利除了一点，我不快乐，而且我不明白为什么。也就是在那时，我决定要找出原因，变得快乐，于是我将研究方向，从计算机科学转向了哲学及心理系，目标只有一个，如何变得更快乐？渐渐地，我的确变得更快乐了。主要因为我接触了一个新的领域，但本质上属于积极心理学范畴，研究积极心理学，把其理念应用到生活中，让我无比快乐，而且这种快乐继续着，于是我决定将其与更多的人分享。选择教授这门学科，这就是积极心理学。1504号心理学课程，我们将一起探索这一全新，相对新兴，令人倾倒的领域，希望同时还能探索我们自己。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>And that was when I switched my concentration from computer science to philosophy and psychology with a single question: how can I become happier? Over time I did become happier. What contributed most to my happiness was
                        when I encountered a
                        new emerging field But essentially research that falls under or within the field of positive psychology. Positive psychology, studying it, applying the ideas to my life has made me significantly happier. It continues to make
                        me happier. And it
                        was when I realized the impact that it had on me that I decided to share it with others. That’s when I decided that I wanted to be a teacher and teach in this field. So this is positive psychology, psychology 1504. And we’ll
                        be exploring this
                        new, relatively new and fascinating field. And hopefully, we will be exploring more than the field ourselves.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      我第一次开设这门课程，是在2002年，是以讨论会的形式，只有8名学生，两名退出了，只剩我和其他六个人，一年后，学生稍微多了一点，有300多人参加，到了第三年，也就是上一次开课，有850人参加，是当时哈佛人数最多的课程，这引起了媒体的关注。因为他们想知道为什么，他们对这一奇特现象非常好奇，“竟然有比经济学导论更热门的课程，怎么可能呢？”。于是我被请去参加各类媒体采访，报纸，广播，电视，从这些采访中，我发现了一种有趣的模式，我前去参加采访，进行采访，结束后，制片人或主持人会送我出来，说些诸如“Tal，多谢你抽空参加采访，不过你跟我想象的不太一样”的话。我漫不经心地问，我无所谓，不过总得回应，“有何不同？”。他们会说，“这个嘛，我们以为你很外向”，下一次采访，结束时仍是如此，“多谢接受采访，不过Tal，你跟我想象得不太一样”。又一次，我漫不经心地问，“这个嘛，我们没想到你会这么内向”，下一次采访，仍是如此。“有何不同？”，“这个嘛，更开朗，更外向”，下一次采访，“这个嘛，太害羞了”，因为采访中我容易紧张。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> When I first taught this class that was back in 2002, I taught it at a seminar and had eight students. Two dropped out. That left me with six. The year after, the class became slightly larger. I had over three hundred
                        students. And then third
                        year when I taught it which was the last time, I had 850 students in the class, making it at that point the largest course at Harvard. And that’s when the media became interested. Because they wanted to understand why. They
                        wanted to understand
                        this phenomenon that “here you have a class, that’s larger than Introduction to Economics”. How could that be? So I was invited by the media for interviews, whether it was newspapers, radio, television. And I started to
                        notice a pattern during
                        those interviews. So I would walk into the interview. We would have the interview. And afterwards, the producer or the interviewer would walk me out and say something to the effects of “well thank you Tal for the interview.
                        But you know I
                        expected you to be different”.And I would ask, as nonchalant as I could of course. I didn’t really care but had to ask anyway, “how different?” And they would say, “Well you know, we expected you to be more outgoing.” Next
                        interview, the end of
                        the interview, same thing. “Thank you for doing the interview. But you know Tal, I expected you to be different.” And once again, nonchalant of course. “Well you know, we expected you to be less, less introversit.” Next
                        interview, same thing.
                        “How different?” “Well, you know, more extroverted. More outgoing.” Next interview. “Well, you know, less shy.” Coz I get very nervous in interviews.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      差不多有几十次采访，每次都是“好交际，更开朗”，“不含蓄，更外向”，诸如此类，最绝的一次，是波士顿一家地方台。我去参加采访，聊了很多，我觉得进行得不错。采访结束，主持人是个热情开朗的男生，他送我出门，拍着我的肩说，“多谢接受我们采访”，然后又是那句，“不过，Tal，你跟我想象得不太一样”。我问，“有何不同”，你要知道，那时候，我已经完全被打击了，不过我还是漫不经心地问，“有何不同？”。他看着我说，“我也说不上，Tal，我以为你会更高些”。更高些？什么？，1米70…是1米69不够格传授快乐吗？我考虑了很久，仔细思量了，整件事从头到尾。我似乎明白为什么他们期望不同了，因为他们要说服自己，说服观众，“这门课怎么会比经济学导论跟热门？”。唯一的解释就是，导师非常外向，充满领袖气质，乐观开朗，当然了，还很高，可惜我的名字少了一个L。但是，是啊，真可惜，所以问题是，他们找答案找错了地方。也就是说，他们不该关注信息传达者，而应该关注信息本身，我怎么知道的呢，因为我参与过其他大学积极心理学课，遍及全国，乃至全球。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> Interview after interview, literally dozens. More outgoing, more cheerful. Less introverted, more extroverted. And on and on. But here is the best one. So this is one of the local channels here around Boston. I was going to
                        the interview. We
                        had a quite long interview, which I thought was actually pretty good. And at the end of the interview, the interviewer is a very jolly guy. He walks me out and puts his hands on my shoulder, and says, “thank you very much for
                        doing the
                        interview.” And then the usual comes. “But you know Tal, I expected you to be different.” And I said, “How different?” Just so you understand, by this time, my self-esteem is short. But still with some resemblance of
                        nonchalance I asked, “how
                        different?” And he looks at me and says, “Well I don’t know Tal. I expected you to be taller.” Taller? What? Five seven, well ok five six and a half is not enough to teach happiness? And I thought about it. I thought about it
                        a lot. The whole
                        pattern from the beginning. And I think I understand why they expected someone different. You see they had to explain to themselves as well as the audience, “how come this lecture is larger than the Introduction to
                        Economics?” And the way to
                        explain it must be that the teacher is very outgoing, extremely charismatic, very cheerful and extrovert and of course, tall. Well, there is one L missing there. But… Yeah. If only. So the problem though is that they were
                        looking in the wrong
                        place for the explanation. In other words, they were looking at the messenger. What they needed to look at was the message. Now how do I know that? You see because I see other positive psychology classes on other campuses
                        around the country and
                        around the world.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p> There are over 200 hundred campuses here in United States that teach positive psychology. On almost every campus where this class is taught, it’s either one of the or the largest class. It’s about the message. I see more
                        and more organizations
                        taking up positive psychology in their, as consultant companies, some of them the leading big consultant companies are taking it on. More and more high schools are introducing positive psychology class. <strong>*</strong>
                        Elementary schools are
                        introducing it. The governments around the world are expressing interest in this new emerging field. Why? Because it works. Because it really works. You see this whole realm on life flourishing, on happiness, on well-being
                        has been until
                        recently dominated by the self-health movement. What do we have in the self-health movement? We have books that are very interesting, that are very accessible. We have speakers who are very outgoing, very charismatic and
                        tall, attracting the
                        masses into these workshops, seminars and lectures. But, there is a very big “but” here. Many of these books, many of these workshops and seminars lack substance. Very often, overpromising and under-delivering.</p>

                    <p>
                      比如，快乐的五个关键，成功领袖的三个要素，成功，快乐，完美爱情的唯一秘诀，夸大其词，效果甚微，再来说说学术界，学术界给我们带来了什么？大量精确的实质内容，数据被一而再，再而三地反复分析，行之有效的好东西。但是，又有一个大大的转折。很少有人会阅读专业学术期刊，想想看，这间教室之外有多少人，读过最近12期《个性与社会心理学》杂志？大多数人甚至不知道那是什么东西。我博士班的主任估算过，学术期刊上的一篇论文平均只有7人阅读，这话…，其中还包括作者的母亲，这话虽然是半开玩笑，但其实很可悲。因为…作为学者，我觉得很可悲，因为这些论文都非常精彩，非常重要，能大有作为，甚至不仅仅是作为，但是对大众来说晦涩难懂，所以我们需要积极心理学，需要这门课程，积极心理学及本课程的宗旨非常明确，就是要在象牙塔及大众间构建桥梁。换句话说，就是要把严谨，实质，经验基础，学术科学，与自助或新纪元运动的通俗易懂相结合。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> Under-delivering. On the other hand, we have academia. What do we have in academia? We have a lot of rigor, a lot of substance. We have datas analyzed, reanalyzed and meta-analyzed. Things that actually work, good stuff.
                        But, and there is also
                        a very big “but” here. Very few people read refereed academic journals. I mean Think about it: how many people outside this room of course have read the last twelve issues of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology?
                        Most people don’t
                        even know what that means. The head of my PHD programs actually estimated the average academic journal article is read by seven people. You know… And that includes the author’s mother. So you know I say half in jest but it’s
                        actually really sad.
                        Because…certainly sad for me, as an academic. Because these things are good. They are important. These things make a difference, can even make more of a difference.<br>But not accessible to most people. And this is where
                        positive psychology
                        comes in. And this is also where this class comes in. The explicit mandate of positive psychology as well as of this class is to create a bridge between Ivory tower and mainstreet. In other words, it is to bring the rigor,
                        the substance, the
                        empirical foundation, the science from academia and merge it with accessibility of the self-help or New Age movement.</p>

                    <p>充分发挥两者所长，这也是积极心理学大受欢迎的原因：有用的科学，本课程将分为两个部分。第一部分会和其他心理学，或者其他任何课程一样，我将向你们介绍相关知识，调查研究，严谨的学术作品，需要你们撰写报告，学术论文，参加考试，跟其他课程一样，而教学内容的另一部分。你们读每一篇论文，写每一篇论文时，都需要思考，如何把这些理念运用到生活中去，运用到恋爱中去，运用到社交圈里去，就是这两个部分，学术与应用，无论是论文还是讲座。我不会因为，某个理论有趣而去介绍它，而是因为这个理论严谨且能被应用，再唠叨几句题外话。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>In a way the best of both worlds. And this explains the popularity of the field of positive psychology: science that works. This class will be taught on two levels. The first level it will be taught as any other class in
                        psychology or any of
                        the classes you’ve taken here. You’ll be introduced here to studies, to research, to rigorous academic work. You’ll be writing paper, academic paper. You’ll be taking exams. Just like every other class. But then it will also
                        be taught at the
                        second level, which is for every paper that you’ll read, every paper that you’ll write, you’ll always be thinking, “Ok, how can I take these ideas and apply them to my life? How can I apply them to my relationship? How can I
                        apply them to my
                        community?” Two levels. The academic. Applied. I did not just introduce whether it’s in the readings or in the lectures ideas just because they are interesting for the sake of the idea. It is always an idea that is both
                        rigorous and can be
                        applied. Just a few words about housekeeping.</p>

                      有几个问题课前就有人问我了。不幸的是这学期将是我最后一次，在哈佛开设积极心理学或其他课程，但愿两年内，明年可能性不大，但是两年内，学校会再次开设积极心理学课程。但我无法保证，关于反馈与提问，如果你有任何问题或不明白的地方，如果你同意或反对什么观点，请给我或助教写邮件，我们一定会回复的。如果某个问题问的人数较多，我们会公开回答，当然一定是匿名的。除非你特别注明可以提及你的名字，有时候讲座过程中，突然有紧急情况，有什么非问不可的问题，无法等待，如果那样的话，请直接举手。因为就跟你要去厕所一样，无法忍耐，无法等待，要去，就去，我们会为此进行积极心理休息，所以大可以打断我，我会回答任何问题。所有幻灯片以及课程视频都会放在网上，课后几天就能下载，幻灯片其实课前就能下载，这样你上课时就能用到，可惜视频不能提前提供，我们试了，但效果不好，所以会在课后一两天内放到网上。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> Some of the questions that I have already received from you before the class started. So this, unfortunately, is the last time that I am teaching positive psychology or any other class for that matter at Harvard. Hopefully
                        within two years,
                        probably not next year, but within two years, there will be positive psychology class offered, but I certainly cannot guarantee it. About feedback and questions. If you have any questions, anything that’s not clear, if you
                        agree or disagree with
                        something, email me or email your TF (Teaching Fellow at Harvard, just like TA at other schools) and we’ll always respond. Sometimes if the question is asked by enough people, we’ll respond to it publicly. Always anonymously.
                        Unless you
                        specified specifically that your name can be mentioned. Sometimes you may be listening to a lecture and then half way through it there is an emergency. There is something that you really have to ask, something that cannot
                        wait. In that case,
                        please just put your hand up. Coz it’s just like when you have to go to the bathroom. Just can’t stop. Can’t wait. And when you gotta go, you gotta go. So we’ll take a positive psychology break for that. And just stop me half
                        way through and
                        I’ll answer any question. All the power points, as well as the videos of the classes will be online. Will be available within couple of days. Well the power points will be available before, say for this lecture it will be
                        before so that you can
                        use them in class. The videos, unfortunately, cannot be made available before. We tried. Couldn’t figure it out. So it will be available within a day or two after.</p>

                      这样做的原因，首先，我当然更希望你们出席课程，能出现在课堂里，和大家一起，在课堂的气氛中学习，而不是仅仅对着电脑。我之所以把资料放在网上是为了，让你们可以重温或者学习错过的课程，这很正常，另一个原因，之所以提前提供幻灯片，我希望你们能充分理解材料，充分参与课堂讨论，而不是忙于记录我说的每一个字，记住每一个词，背诵每一句话，我不希望你们被动地记录，幻灯片上的内容或者我说的话，而是要主动记录，也就是要充分理解材料。比如，如果你们听到某个理论，觉得，“挺有趣的”，标上星号，写下来，或者觉得“也许我可以应用这点”，那就写下来。或者“跟我妈妈讲讲”，或者“跟我室友队友讲讲”，那就写下来，主动笔记与被动笔记有两方面不同。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> And the reason why they are up there. First of all, I do prefer that you attend lecture. I do prefer that you are physically here. You get things in the energy of the room with so many students so you wouldn’t just get from
                        your computer. The
                        reason why I do put them up is so that you have the opportunity if you want to see it again or if you have to miss a class. That’s perfectly fine. And also because, and this is also the reason why the power points are always
                        available, I want
                        you to be engaged in the material. I want you to be engaged in whatever it is that we are discussing in class. Not necessarily thinking about getting down every word that I say on paper, remembering everything, memorizing
                        everything. I want you
                        to take rather than passive notes of writing down what is on the power point or every word that I say. I’d like you to take active notes. And that means being engaged with the material. For example, if you heard something and
                        idea and you say,
                        “Oh, that’s interesting.” Star it. Write it down. Or “Ok I think I’ll start applying this.” Write it down. “Or I want to tell my mom about this later.” Or “I want to talk to my roommates or my team about this idea.” Write it
                        down. Active
                        note-taking is opposed to passive note-taking for two reasons.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> 首先，正如我刚才说的，&gt;
                      这门课是关于如何改变生活，我不会仅为了学术之美而教授此课。虽然这一领域的确有许多学术之美，所以发现可以实际运用的，就写下来。第二个原因是，你会记住更多，主动参与，集中注意，更好地理解材料，而不是被动做笔记。在这整个课程中，从下周开始，我们将进行我所说的，“练习时间”，而不是“休息时间”，其实类似“休息时间”，这段时间会我们停止课程，进行内省，也就是课堂上的安静时刻。我会停一两分钟，你们可以盯着我或者周围人发呆，或者思考一下之前讨论的内容，或者解答我提出的提示问题。之所以进行“练习时间”，这是今年新提出的，上学期并没有，因为上次课程结束后到现在的两年，我做了大量关于安静的研究。关于安静时刻的重要性，无论是课堂里，讲座里，还是家中，无论是对公司领导，爱情关系，甚至学龄前儿童，你们中很多人，在经历“练习时间”时可能会疑惑，“我一年付四万美金就是为了这个？”，“坐在教室里发呆？”。首先，每次只有一两分钟，一堂课最多不超过两次；第二，这可能是，你从本课程中学到的最重要的东西，即享受安静这一理念，我来读一段麻省理工两位教授的研究。我所提到名字不会出现在幻灯片上，不必背诵或记录，只是为了启发你们。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>First of all, as I said, this class is a class about making a difference in people’s lives. I would not be teaching the class just for its academic beauty, although there is a lot of academic beauty in this field. So write
                        down if you have an
                        idea that you think you can apply. The second reason why we should that is because you’ll remember more. Better attention, better understanding of the material if you are actively engaged, as opposed to just taking down
                        passive notes. Throughout
                        the class, starting next week, we’ll take what I called, “time-ins” as opposed to “time-outs”. it’s like a time-out. It’s the time where we stop the class and you look inward. And this is literally a time of silence in a
                        class.I will stop for a
                        minute or two. And you’ll have a chance either to just stare at me or anyone else, or think about what we’ve just discussed, or have a guiding question that I will provide you that you’ll address during the class. The reason
                        why I have
                        “Time-ins”… This is something that I am introducing this year for the first time. We didn’t have it last time. It’s because over the last two years since I last taught it, I’ve done a lot work in the area of silence. I’ve
                        read a lot of research
                        in this area about the importance of quiet times whether it’s in a class, in a lecture, whether it is at home, whether it is for a leader in the business, for relationship, for children starting from pre-schools. Now many of
                        you, as you are
                        going through these “time-ins” if you decide to take this class may think, “Well, is this what I’m paying 40,000 dollars a year for? To sit a class and be quiet?” First of all, it will only be a minute or two at a time, maybe
                        once or twice a
                        lecture. But second, it is maybe the most important thing you’ll take from this class. The notion of embracing stillness. Let me read to you an excerpt from a study that was run by two MIT professors. By the way, all the
                        names that I read and
                        that are not on the power points, you don’t need to remember or write down. This is just for your edification.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>David，Foster和Matthew，Wilson教授，都来自麻省理工大学，他们研究证实了“练习时间”的重要性，开始内省的时间，他们在老鼠处在迷宫中及脱离迷宫后，分别对它们进行了脑扫描，以下是他们的发现。实验结果表明，当某种经历正在进行时，即老鼠进行迷宫时，是当你尝试分辨，什么才是重要的，什么舍弃什么保留，进行安静的自省时，他们的实验表明，接连不断反复进入迷宫的老鼠，比进行一次迷宫后，稍事放松，来点小酒的老鼠，学到的少得多，经历，享受安静。这很能说明问题，对人类也一样，不仅仅是实验小白鼠，所有人类都是，他们认为“重现可能形成一种学习记忆机制”，包括学习，理解，记忆，保留。当我们思考时，我们重放素材时，更容易保留，记住之前的经历，所以休息时间的重要性不能被忽视。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>So David Foster and Matthew Wilson. Both of them are from MIT. Indeed the following study that I think confirms the importance of “time-in”, time to look inside. What they did is they scanned the brains of rats while they
                        were in a maze and
                        after they went through the maze. And here’s what they found. “What the results suggest is that while there certainly is some record of your experience as it is occurring. in other words when they were doing the maze, when
                        you try to figure out:
                        ‘What was important? What should I keep and throw away?’ during periods of quiet wakeful introspection. What they show was rats who went through the maze and went through the maze again and again, learned far less than rats
                        who took time aside,
                        chilled out a little bit after a maze, had more margarita. Experience, embrace stillness. This has implications and they showed implications to human beings as well. Not only those of the rat race, all human beings. So what
                        they say is that
                        “replay might constitute a general mechanism of learning and memory”. Both learning, understanding, as well as memory, retention. When we reflect, when we replay the material, we are much more likely to retain, to remember
                        what we have just been
                        through. So the importance of time aside cannot be over-emphasized.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> Parker Palmer在他的教学著作，《教学的勇气》一书中，提到了以下一段话，语言不是教学的唯一媒介。安静同样可以进行教育，安静让我们有机会反省我们所说所闻，在真正的教育中，安静为学生进行内省提供可靠环境，是一种最深层次的学习媒介，而安静恰恰是我们文化所缺失的。很多人可能读过《万里任禅游》，作者Robert M
                      Pirsig还写过另一本书，没那么知名，叫《寻找莱拉》。这本书是对印第安人的人类学研究，两种文化最突出的特点之一是，印第安人崇尚安静，他发现和印第安人坐在一起。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>In his wonderful book of teaching, Parker Palmer– it’s called The Courage to Teach, says the following– Words are not the sole medium of exchange in teaching and learning. We educate with silence as well. Silence gives us a
                        chance to reflect on
                        what we have said and heard. In authentic education, silence is treated as a trustworthy matrix for the inner work students must do, a medium for learning of the deepest sort.” Silence is something that is missing from our
                        culture. I know that
                        many of you have probably read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert M. Pirsig. He had a second book out, less well-known, called Lila (Lila: an Inquiry into Morals). And Lila is an anthropological study of Native
                        Americans. And one
                        of the distinguishing characteristics between these two cultures is their approach were silence. What he found was when he went and sat around with Native Americans.</p>

                      他们围坐在篝火边两三个小时，一句话也没说，只是坐在那儿，看着对方，微笑，享受美好时光，内省，就这样几个小时。他指出，在我们文化中沉默，让人不适，我们试图打破沉默，这是一项重要的文化差异，我们为缺乏安静付出了代价，我们会重点讨论这一代价，涉及到恋爱，美德与道德，以及快乐与幸福感。下面介绍一下积极心理学的背景，它是如何诞生的，这门课是如何诞生的。从很多方面来说，积极心理学是，人本主义心理学的产物和衍生，人本主义心理学本质上是，对当时各种心理学派系的不同意见，人本主义心理学的创始人，称之为心理学上的“第三势力”，为什么是“第三势力”？</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>of words, with the absence of sound or noise. We have to fill up all the gaps. This is an important cultural difference. And we pay a price for this lack of stillness. A price that we’ll talk about a lot, when I talk about
                        relationships, when I
                        talk about virtue and morality and when we talk about happiness and wellbeing in general. Let me give a little bit background on positive psychology: how we came about and how this class came about. In many ways, positive
                        psychology is the
                        brainchild, the product and the grandchild of humanistic psychology. What we have in humanistic psychology is essentially a reaction to the existing psychologies of the time. The founders, considered the founders of
                        humanistic psychology in fact

                    <p> 因为第一势力是<strong>行为主义</strong>，代表人物有斯金纳、华生、桑代克，这是第一势力；第二势力是<strong>精神分析学</strong>，创建者包括弗洛伊德、荣格以及阿德勒，这是第二势力；第三势力，<strong>人本主义心理学</strong>作为对其的<strong>异议</strong>出现。首先是对行为主义的异议，行为主义认为人的主体性，认为人是一个行为集合，就像一只被击打而四处滚动的台球，被增强，奖惩驱动。而人本主义心理学认为，我们不只是被击打的台球，我们有精神，有灵魂，我们有重要的认知与思想，不能只靠行为观察，改善人生，然后是第二势力精神分析学，精神分析学主要通过潜意识分析。它决定你的理解，决定如何改善生活，还有防卫机制，人类本能论，神经症。如果你理解这些黑暗势力，就能更好地处理生活，了解并改善生活质量。</p>

                      <p>Because the first force was behaviorism. The work of Skinner (B. F. Skinner), the work of Watson (John B. Watson), the work of Thorndik (Edward Thorndik). This was the first force. The second force was psychoanalysis. The
                        work of Freud (Sigmund
                        Freud), Jung (Carl Jung), Adler (Alfred Adler) to some extent. This was the second force. And the third force, humanistic psychology came as a reaction to it. First it is a reaction to behaviorism. Behaviorism looks at the
                        human entity, at the
                        person as basically a collection of behaviors as a box, like a billiard ball knocked around by reinforcements, by punishment, by reward. And what humanistic psychology said was that we are much more than a billiard ball being
                        knocked around. We
                        have spirit. We have a soul. We have cognitions and thoughts that matter. It’s not just behavior that is important for understanding as well as improving life. And then psychoanalysis, the second force. The psychoanalysis is
                        about basically
                        understanding mostly through the subconscious: that’s how you understand it; that’s how you improve the quality of life. There are defense mechanisms, there are biological instincts, neurosis– and if you understand these very
                        often dark forces,
                        were better able to deal with life: understand as well as improve the quality of life.</p>

                      人本主义心理学认为人类不止如此，不仅仅是生理本能，不仅仅是神经症，不仅仅是牛顿学说世界里的台球，我们要重视人的本质，给予人更多的自尊和自由。但有一个问题，人本主义心理学缺少严谨的方法论，但它引入了许多精彩的理念，对于幸福感的研究，乐观主义的研究，善良，道德，美德，爱，两性关系，巅峰体验，自我实现，移情，这些精彩的概念都会在本学期探讨，它的认识论并不严谨。如何形成理念，如何学习，所以在很多方面，大部分，不完全但大部分成为了自助运动，有趣，有益，重要的理念。意图当然是好的，但就某种程度上，缺乏学术严谨性，所以它在学术上影响很小，所以很少有大学开设人本主义心理学，几乎没有，所以本质上成为了新纪元运动。但是，我们很快会了解到，人本主义心理学，孕育了积极心理学，然我们先见见祖父祖母。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> Humanistic psychology says human beings are much more than that. Much more than biological instincts, much more than neurosis, much more than the person who exists in a Newtonian reality like a billiard ball. We need to
                        value much more the
                        human being. We need to give much more dignity and freedom to the person. There was a problem. The problem was humanistic psychology is said lacked the rigorous methodology. While it brought in many wonderful ideas, talked
                        about the study of
                        well-being, talked about the study of optimism, of kindness, of morality, of virtue, of love, of relationships, of peak experiences, of self-actualization, of empathy. All these wonderful concepts that we’ll talk about
                        throughout the semester.
                        It wasn’t as rigorous about its epistemology, about how we form ideas and how we learn. And that’s why, in many ways, largely, not completely but largely more of into the self-health movement. Interesting ideas, good ideas,
                        important ideas,
                        certainly good intentions, but to some extent, without the academic rigor. And that’s why it lacked the impact on academia. That’s why we don’t have partly any humanistic psychology classes offered in universities today.
                        There are very few still
                        around. And this is why also a lot of it became the New Age essentially. But still, it’s humanistic psychology that has in many ways fathered and mothered, as we’ll see, positive psychology. So let’s meet the grandparents.</p>

                    <p> 比如Rollo，May和Carl Rogers，还有最著名的Abraham Maslow 曾是美国心理学会主席，布兰迪斯大学教授，他于1954年提出了人本主义心理学，他写了一章《为了积极心理学》。1954年，他在其中写到，我们需要研究，善良，美德，快乐与乐观，可以说这是超前于他时代的。如果说Maslow是祖父，那Karen
                      Horney就是祖母了，她最初是精神分析学者，学习弗洛伊德的理论，意识到其过于注重消极面，神经症，精神病。她认为，还必须关注影响人类生命体的东西，我们需要研究培养那些好的品质，因为它们也是我们的一部分，反而向人本主义靠近了，并由此产生了，积极心理学。还有Aaron
                      Antonovsky，第三位祖父级人物，提出了关注健康的理念，他提出了一个新概念，或者说他引进了一个新概念，我还在，别担心，他引进了一个新概念，他称之为，他个人创造的新词，健康本源学。由两部分组成，saluto健康，geneis起源。健康的起源，这是病理学常规模型的，替代模型，也就是说除了研究病理学，无论是生理健康，还是心理健康，还需要研究健康的起源，这也是预防医学所关注的。这在1970年代，是一个全新的理念，我们会仔细讨论Aaron
                      Antonovsky，现在转到父辈。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> way ahead of his time. Then if Maslow is the grandfather, then Karen Horney is the grandmother. Initially a psychoanalyst, trained through the works of Freud, she realized the focuses had been too much on the negative– on
                        neurosis, on
                        psychosis and said we also, not only but also have to focus on what is working on human organism. We have to work and look at the fine qualities and cultivate those. Because part of being human is being those things as well.
                        In many ways,
                        brought about the movement toward humanistic psychology and through that– positive psychology. Aaron Antonovsky, the third person I would consider the grandfather, brought in the idea of focusing on health. He has a new
                        concept. Or he introduced
                        a new concept. I’m still here. Don’t worry. He introduced a new concept, which he called– his own neologism, “salutogenesis”. Salutogenesis: saluto–(which is) health; geneis (which is) origin. The origin of health. And this
                        was an alternative
                        model, to the conventional ways model of pathologies. So instead of just studying pathologies whether it’s in physical health or psychological health, we should also study the origin of health. In many ways that is what
                        prevented medicine is
                        about. So this was a novel idea back in 1970s when he introduced it. And we’ll talk a lot about Aaron Antonovsky. Now the parents.</p>

                    <p> Martin Seligman被认为是积极心理学之父，与一群相关学者，于1998年确立了这一领域，和马斯洛一样，也是美国心理协会会长。他任职期间的首要任务，是实现两个目标。<strong>第一，让学院式心理学变得通俗，也就是说，连接起象牙塔与普罗大众，这是他任职期间的第一目标；第二，是引进一个积极的心理学，需要着眼于有用的东西，不仅仅是研究，抑郁，焦虑，精神分裂，神经症，还需要关注，爱，两性关系，自尊，动机，恢复以及幸福感。</strong>他提出了这些理念，从那时起便蓬勃发展起来。在Martin
                      Seligman之前，都发生在1998年，下次我们会详谈，这都诞生于1998年，而早在1998年前，Ellen Langer教授就已研究了这些领域。将人本主义精神与学术科学严谨性结合，我们对她的讨论会比对其他人多。还有一位哈佛的教授，积极心理学的另一位父辈，Philip Stone，两年前的昨天去世了。两位都是我的物理学导师，带我进入了积极心理学领域的研究，1998年我第一次参加积极心理学峰会。Stone教授带我同去，我那时在攻读硕士学位。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> the field in 1998. Like Maslow, he too, was the President of American Psychological Association. And as his mandate, during his presidency, he had two aims: the first aim– to make academic psychology more accessible, – in
                        other words– bridge
                        Ivory tower and mainstreet. This was the first aim of his presidency. The second aim was introduce a positive psychology. A psychology that will look at also things that work, that were not just study– depression, anxiety,
                        schizophrenia and
                        neurosis. A psychology a network of scholars who will focus on – love, relationships, self-esteem, motivation, resilience and well-being. And he introduced these ideas and it’s all been literally uphill from then. Before
                        Martin Seligman, this
                        all happened in 1998 and we’ll talk about it a little bit more next time. This all happened in 1998. Long before 1998, our very own professor Ellen Langer did research in all these areas, bringing the humanistic spirit and
                        combining it with the
                        academic scientific rigor. We’ll be talking probably more than any other scholar about her work in this class. And another person from Harvard, one of the parents of positive psychology was Philip Stone, who passed away two
                        years ago, yesterday.
                        Both Langer and Stone were my physicist advisors, introduced me to the field of positive psychology into this research. In 1998 when I had the first positive psychology summit, Professor Stone took me along with him. I was a
                        graduate student.</p>

                      1999年，他首次在哈佛开设了本课程，在全球范围内也是首批，我是他的教研员。两年后，他又重新开设了课程，我仍旧担任教研员，后来我毕业了，他提议我接手他的课程。直到今天，这就是1504号心理学课程，我再来讲讲…接下来的半小时，我会向你们介绍下这门课的内容，首先，这门课不光是传授信息，而且关于如何变形，显而易见，这是什么意思。如今大多数教育都只是传达信息，什么是信息。比如，我们有一个容器，也就是我们的思想，信息就是接收数据，接收科学，接收信息，储存到容器里，这就是信息。等容器填满了，我们就毕业了，信息数据越多越好，这还不够，因为信息无法决定我们的幸福感，我们的成功，自尊，动机水平，两性关系及其质量。光有信息还不够，变形则是把容器的形状改变，“trans”即改变，“form”即形状，改变形状，这就是变形。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> In 1999 he taught the first positive psychology class at Harvard, one of the first in the world. I was his teaching fellow. A couple of years later, he taught it again. Again I was his teaching fellow. And then when I
                        graduated, he suggested I
                        take over his class. And here we are today. So this is 1504. Let me give you a sense of, in the next half an hour and so, a sense of what you expect in this class. The first thing is this class is not just about information,
                        it is also
                        explicitly about transformation. What do I mean by that? You see most of education today is about information. What is information? So we have a container, which is our mind. And information is about taking data, taking
                        science, taking
                        information and putting it inside the form. That is information. Now when this form is filled, that’s when we are educated. More information, more data, better. Not enough. Because it’s not just information that determines
                        our wellbeing, our
                        success, our self-esteem, our motivational level, the relationship and the quality of our relationships. It’s much more than information. Transformation is about taking this form and changing it. Trans, (which is) change,
                        form, (which is) shape.
                        Change the form. This is transformation. This is the distinction that I learned first from at the school.</p>

                    <p> 这是Robert
                      Kegan教授，教我的第一区别，接收信息，关注信息本身是不够的。听听这个例子，你去参加运动会，目标是进入前三，获得奖牌，但是只获得第八名，你会如何分析，你会如何解读？太糟糕了，我彻底失败了，你灰心丧气，感到无力。但从另一角度看，同样的比赛，你期望获得前三，但只得到第八，你可以解读为“我学到了什么？，我还需要更努力地训练”，你会更有动力，从经验中学习，也就是说，同样的客观信息，”我是第八名，我目标前三”。同样的信息，截然不同的解读，一个认为是灾难，另一个则当成机遇，一个让人失去动力，另一个增加动力，还有一个很普遍的例子，世界各地很多人似乎有用了一切，人生顺利，生活富庶，但仍旧不快乐。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Professor Robert Kegan who taught about this. Information in and of itself is not enough. Think about this example. You go for an athletic meet. Your aim is to get into the top three– to be a medalist. You come in number
                        eight. What’s the
                        analysis? What’s the interpretation? – Terrible. I just failed. You feel deflated. Enervated. On the other hand, the exact same event. You came eight when you expected to be top three. You can interpret it as “Ok, so what
                        have I learned? I need
                        to work even harder.” You become more energized. You learned from the experience. In other words, the same objective information which is “I got eighth; I expected top three”. The same information, very different
                        interpretation. One is a
                        disaster, the other interpretation is an opportunity. One leads to loss of energy, the other one to increasing energy. Or think about another very common example. We know of many people around the world who seemingly have
                        everything, who are
                        doing well, who have more than they need. And yet they are unhappy.</p>

                    <p>
                      而另一些人拥有的不多，但从未中断，从未停止享受人生，还有相反的情况，拥有一切的人，充满感恩，享受生活，生活窘迫的人觉得自己是受害者。也就是说，重要的不仅仅是获得了什么信息，还有是何形状，如何解读，如何理解，关注的重点。这就是由容器的形状所决定的，这是我在本科生阶段所认识到的，表面上看，我拥有了一切，体育运动，学术，社交都很成功，但是我对生命的理解，关注和解读并不正面，我不快乐，我们后面会讲，通常解读比信息更重要。有一句话我会在课程中经常引用，快乐由我们的精神状态而定，而不是社会地位或银行存款，所以需要变形，这对建立幸福感来说很重要，所以我们在实际操作时，不会传达过多信息方面的东西，而是挖掘更多东西，不是联想意义上的，而是学术意义上的，也就是说，我们要挖掘自身潜能，这种潜能一直存在，只是我们没有发现，或者被其他东西掩盖了。我们要发现利用它，以便关注它，以便理解它，我讲个故事来说明吧。比如米开朗基罗，曾经有个记者问他，您是如何创造出《大卫》这件巨作的？米开朗基罗回答，</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> 很简单，我去了趟采石场，看见一块巨大的大理石，我在它身上看到了大卫，我只要凿去多余的石头，只留下有用的，凿去多余的石头之后，大卫就诞生了。</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> 虽然说的比做的容易，但是这个故事抓住了这门课程精髓，即凿除多余石块，也就是摆脱限制。阻碍，或者对失败的恐惧，这些东西在并不是与生俱来的，但如今却出现在了大多数人身上，要凿除削弱甚至伤害我们的完美主义，凿除胜利的能力。因为我们可能害怕胜利，可能对生命中一些东西感到内疚，这些都会反过来限制我们，也许甚至还要凿除两性关系中的限制，尤其是带来消极面的时候。这些就是本课程的主要内容。<br>
                      就像俗话说的那样，“做减法比做加法让灵魂成长得更快”，减法包括除去那些，阻碍我们发挥潜能的限制，因为我们的潜能是天生的，我们关注人类本性，是与生俱来的，无论是上帝赐予的，还是进化产生的，但是渐渐地受到外部文化压力，像多余石料一样，把我们禁锢起来了。老子说过，<strong>“为学日益，为道日损”，“学”即信息，“道”即变形</strong>。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>And then there are people around the world who have very little. And yet they never cease, never stop to celebrate life. And we have another way around as well. People who have everything and appreciate it and enjoy life.
                        People who have very
                        little and who see themselves as victim. In other words, it’s not just the information that goes in. It’s also the shape, the interpretation, the perception, the focus. And that is determined by the shape of the form. This is
                        what I realized
                        when I was an undergrad here. Seemingly, looking in from the outside, I had everything. Doing well (in) sports, academics and socially. And yet my perception, my focus, my interpretation of life– not that great. I wasn’t
                        happy. The
                        interpretation matters very often a lot more as we’ll see than the information that goes in. One of the sentences that I’ll repeat throughout the class is that happiness is much more contingent on our state of mind than our
                        status or the state
                        of our bank account. And that’s where transformation comes in. And that’s why it’s so important for wellbeing. What that will look like in practice is that we’ll cover not so much information. We’ll uncover much more and I
                        don’t mean that in the
                        Berkeley (George Berkeley) sense of the word.<br>324<br>I mean that in the academic sense of the word. In other words, what we’ll do is uncover potential that we have inside, that we have inside of us all along. Maybe we just
                        didn’t see. Or
                        maybe it’s obscured by something or another. We’ll uncover it so that we can utilize it, so that we can focus on it, so that we can perceive it. Here is a story just to illustrate it. So this is Michelangelo.<br>One day he
                        was asked by a
                        journalist of his time, “how did you create this most amazing masterpiece, David?”, to which Michelangelo responded, “it was easy. I went to the quarry. I saw this huge piece of marble. And in it I saw David. All I needed to
                        do was to chip away
                        the excess stone, to get rid of the marble that shouldn’t have been there. And when I got rid of this excess stone, there was David. “ Not obviously easier said than done. But the story captured the metaphor of what this
                        class very much is
                        about. It’s about chipping away the excess stone. It’s about getting rid of limitations, of barriers, whether it’s the fear of failure, something that we didn’t have as kids. But today most people in our culture have it. It’s
                        about chipping away
                        perfectionism that is debilitating and often hurts us. It’s about chipping away our ability for success, because maybe we are afraid of success. Maybe we feel guilty about some of the things that we have in our life, and that
                        in turn limits us.
                        Maybe it’s about chipping away the limitations on our relationships in while we don’t thrive within them.<br>This is what this class is mostly about. As Dero (?) says, “soul grows more by subtraction than by addition”, by
                        getting rid of these
                        limitations, limitations that are preventing us from fulfilling our potential. Because our potential is in there in nature. We talk a lot about human nature. It’s there whether it’s through God, whether it’s through
                        evolution. We have a lot of
                        potential that over time with we fix (?) stone of voices with being part of our culture that very often these limitations are put on top of us just like the excess stone. Lao Tzu, “In pursuit of knowledge every day something
                        is acquired. In
                        pursuit of wisdom, every day something is dropped.” Knowledge is<br>325<br>about information. Wisdom is about transformation. I was recently interviewed for a newsletter on coaching before a large conference on the topic. And
                        the interviewer
                        asked me, “So what tips, what tools can you give from positive psychology?”</p>

                    <p>我最近参加一次大型咨询业会议时，接受了一家相关期刊的采访，采访者问我，“能给读者传授些积极心理学建议吗”？于是我谈到了一些热门话题，感恩的重要性，体育锻炼的重要性，我谈到了花时间经营爱情的重要性，谈到了休息，简化等等。我正滔滔不绝时，她打断了我，说，谢谢，Tal，这些都不错，那些事情的重要性，我明白，但这些我们的读者都已经知道了，我想要的是轰动的因素，能让我意外的东西，能否告诉我们的读者？”。我想了一会这个问题，然后意识到根本没有什么惊奇可言，我跟她这么说了，“所谓的轰动之处就是没有轰动之处”，就是这样，因为没有经过转变，快速见效的说法都是皇帝的新衣。是不存在的，是过高的承诺和过低的兑现，生活，令人满意的生活，丰富的生活包括了起起落落，包括了痛苦和再次振作，包括了失败和再次奋斗。它包括了成功和庆祝成功，胜利和失败，起起和落落，我们下个星期会讲到，而不是关乎一个秘密，一个能让人过上幸福生活的令人惊奇的诀窍，而你们将在本课程中学到的许多东西，都是你们之前听说过的，也许对你来说没有什么新鲜的内容。在你内心深处你已经知道了，你会说“这是常识”，是的，很多都是常识，但是，伏尔泰曾经说过，“常识并非那么平常”。特别是应用于实际，所以本课程的目标是让常识更平常，特别是应用到实际中，在本课程结束时，我所希望的是，在本课程结束之时，如果你打算上这门课的话。</p>

                      <p>importance of gratitude, the importance of physical exercise. I talked about the importance of spending time on our relationships, about taking time aside and simplifying and so on and so on. As I was going through my long
                        list, she stopped me
                        and she said, “You know Tal, this is all good. The importance of stuff, I know. But our readers already know that. I am looking for the Wow factor. Come on, surprise me. What can you tell our readers?” And I thought about
                        this question for a
                        minute and I realized that there is no Wow. And I told her that, “you know if there is a wow, the wow is that there is no wow.” That’s it. Because the over-not-transformation emperor, the emperor of quick fixes has no
                        clothes.<br>It doesn’t
                        exist. it’s over-promising and under-delivering. A life, a fulfilling life, a rich life includes ups and downs, includes pain and getting up again, includes failure and getting up again. It includes success and celebrating
                        it. Victories and
                        losses, ups and downs, as we’ll talk about next week. It’s not about this one secret. One Wow to the good life. And many of the things you will learn in this class, you’ve heard of before. Probably nothing new to you. You
                        already know it inside
                        of you. And you are going to say, “Well, it is common sense.” And yes, a lot of it is common sense. However, it is Voltaire once said, “Common sense is not that common.” And this especially applies to application. So the aim
                        of this class is to
                        make common sense more common, especially in the real world application. At the end of the class, here’s what I am hoping for, at the end of the class, if you decide to take it.</p>

                      在本学期结束时，我不想，我不期待你跑来告诉我，“谢谢你教给了这么多新东西”，那不是我所期待的。我不认为那会发生，我所希望发生的是你过来跟我说，不是说“谢谢你教了我”，之类的话，而是“谢谢提醒了我一些我熟知事情”，这就是本课程要做的。经常性的提醒，一周两次，经常提醒你们记起你们已知的东西，你们内心深处的东西，你们心中的大卫，本课程希望做到的是帮助你们凿掉一些束缚。不管是哪种束缚，是阻碍你认识已熟知事物的认知束缚，还是阻碍你从已熟知事物中获取益处的情绪束缚，抑或是行为束缚，基本要素是影响，行为和认知，正是我们在改变周将要讨论的，我要让常识更平常。信息本身还不够，还不够，而我们除了信息高速公路外还需要转变高速公路，是在转变高速公路，还是转变乡村小道上，来经历快速增长的步伐，因为就像我们下次课会说到的那样，抑郁率呈上升趋势，焦虑率呈上升趋势，不只是在这个国家，是全球化的现象，简直就是全球传染病。而为了应对它，更多的信息也并不够，并不够。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>“Wow! Thank you for teaching me so many new things.” That’s not what I am expecting. I don’t think that is what will happen. What I hope will happen is for you to come and say, rather than “thank you for teaching me”,
                        something you would say
                        “thank you for reminding me of something that I’ve already known”. And this is what this class is about. It’s constant reminder, twice a week. Constant reminder of what you already know, of what is inside you. The David that
                        is inside you. And
                        what this class will hopefully do is to help you chip away some of these limitations, whether it’s limitation, cognitive limitations that prevent you from seeing what you already knew, emotional limitations that are
                        preventing you from deriving
                        the benefits of what you already know, or behavioral limitations. The ABC: affect, behavior, and cognition that we’ll talk about during the change week. So I’m making common sense more common. Information in and of itself is
                        simply not enough.
                        It’s not enough and what we need in addition to our information highway is a transformation highway. Transformation high way, or transformation back roads, to come through the fast increasing pace. Because as we’ll talk about
                        next time, rates of
                        depression are on the rise, rates of anxiety are on the rise, not just in this country, globally. It’s literally global epidemic. And to deal with it, more information will just not do. Just not enough.</p>

                    <p> 下面是Archibald
                      MacLeish的话，他生前是一位诗人，是哈佛的教授，“错的不是科学的重大发现，有信息永远比无知强，不管是什么样信息和什么样无知，错在于信息背后的信念，认为信息会改变世界的信念，但它不会”。往我们的容器里增加，装上越来越多的东西，越来越多的信息，越来越多的数据，还是不够，我们需要更多，本课程将采用一种人性的方法。我来给你们读一小段Abraham，Maslow的话，“如果有人上了一门关于心理学学习的课，或者看了一本这方面的书，大部分内容，在我看来，是与重点无关的，也就是，与人性无关，大部分内容把学习展现为获得联想，技能和能力，这些对于人的性格，人的个性，人本身来说只是外在而并非本质的”。外在是指信息，内在是指转变，形态的改变，当我们谈到转变时，实际上是非常字面的说法，形态的改变，大脑的改变，我们一会就谈到，比如我们会谈到冥想。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>information or what ignorance. What is wrong is the belief behind the information, the belief that information will change the world. It won’t.” Just adding it and filling up our containers with more and more stuff. More and
                        more information,
                        more and more data. It’s just not enough. We need more than that. This class will take a humanistic approach. Let me read you a quick excerpt by Abraham Maslow who talks about this approach, “If one took a course or picked up
                        a book on the
                        psychology of learning, most of it, in my opinion, would be beside the point - that is, beside the ‘humanistic’ point. Most of it would present learning as the acquisition of associations, of skills and capacities that are
                        external and not
                        intrinsic to the human character, to the human personality, to the person himself.” External refers to information. Internal refers to the transformation, the changing of the form. And when we talk about transformation,
                        actually mean it quite
                        literally– changing of the form, changing of the brain as we’ll talk about. We’ll talk about meditation for instance.</p>

                    <p>
                      自1998年后通过核磁共振研究我们知道大脑可以被改变，一个新的概念叫做神经形成或者神经可塑性，是指我们的大脑实际上会改变和转变，在我们的一生中其形态都在改变，所以我不只是在打比方，我也经常指的是字面意义。继续Abraham，Maslow的话，“人性的哲学衍生出关于学习，教学和教育的新概念，简单地说，这一概念认为教育的功能，教育的目标，人的目标，人性的目标，只要人还是被关注的目标，从根本上是一个人的自我实现，完全成为一个人，达到人类或者是特定的某个个人，能达到的最高高度。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>We know our brain today can actually change through MRI studies since 1998. A new concept came up which is Neurogenesis or Neuroplasticity, meaning our brain actually changes and transforms. It changes its form throughout
                        our life. So I don’t
                        just mean it metaphorically, I also very often mean it literally. Abraham Maslow continues, “Humanistic philosophy offers a new conception of learning, of teaching, and of education. Stated simply, such a concept holds that
                        the function of
                        education, the goal of education— the human goal, the humanistic goal, the goal so far as human beings are concerned— is ultimately the “self-actualization” of a person, the becoming fully human, the development of the
                        fullest height that the
                        human species can stand up to or that the particular individual can come to.</p>

                      人成为最好的自己，这些是军队的广告，“做最好的自己”，这就是本课程所要讲的，这就是人性的方法。关于实现我们的潜能，凿掉那些束缚，现在对于你们许多人这种方式似乎很天真，很理想主义，并不天真，但理想主义，我们会谈到和讨论理想主义和保持理想主义的重要性，如果我们要介绍个人的改变，个人之间的改变，或群体与社会的改变的话。本课程不是提供，关于美好生活和幸福的答案的，是关于辨识正确的问题，“问过之后便会有收获”，圣经如是说，本课程就是我认为的教育的宗旨，也就是对信息和转变的探索。必须由一个问题开始，探索，问题，这两者在词源上有所关联并非巧合，在本课程中，我们会问，你们会被问许多问题，你们将会看到那些问题，创造了现实。我们下次会讲到，那些你首先向你自己，然后向你的搭档，学生，搭档，未来的雇员，和同事提出的问题的重要性，问题十分重要。</p>

                      <p> In a less technical way, it is helping the person to become the best that he is able to become.” And this was before the Ad came up for the army. That “Be all you can be.” This is what the class is about. It’s the
                        humanistic approach. It’s
                        about fulfilling our potential, chipping away those limitations. Now to many of you this may sound naive, idealistic. Naive it is not. Idealistic, it is. And we’ll talk about and discuss the importance of idealism and
                        maintaining idealism if we
                        are to introduce personal change, inter-personal change, or community or society change. This class is not about providing answers, concerning the good life and happiness. It is about identifying the right questions. “Ask and
                        ye shall you
                        receive”, say the Scripture. This class is what I think education is all about, which is that the quest for information and transformation must begin with the question. Quest, question, there is no coincidence that there is
                        an etymological link
                        between the two. In this class we’ll be asking, you’ll be asked many questions, questions that as you’ll see, create reality. We’ll talk about it already next time. The importance of the questions you ask of yourselves first
                        and foremost, of
                        your partner, of your students, of your parents, of your employees in the future, teammates and so on. Questions make a difference.</p>

                      <p>The educator, Neil Postman once said, “The kids enter schools as question marks and they leave as periods.” My hope in this class is to bring up many more question marks than periods. Once again, it’s about chipping away the
                        excess stone
                        because as kids, we are always asking questions. We are always curious. Let me show you a quick excerpt from a video of one of my favorite psychologists, actually the comedian, Seinfeld. We will watch a lot of excerpts
                        throughout the semester.
                        Talking about what we were like as kids. See is this in your way “So, the first couple of years I made my own costumes which of course sucked: the ghost, the hobo… Then, finally, the third year, begging the parents, I got the
                        Superman Halloween
                        costume. Not surprisingly. Cardboard box, self-made top, mask included. Remember the rubber band on the back of that mask? That was a quality item there, wasn’t it?</p>

                      <p> That was good for about 10 seconds before it snapped out of that cheap little staple they put it in there with. You go to your first house: “Trick or…” Snap!” It broke. I don’t believe it!” “Wait up you guys! I gotta fix
                        it! Hey wait up! Wait
                        up!” Kids don’t say “wait”. They say “wait up! Hey wait up!” Coz when you are little your life is up. Your future is up. Everything you want is up. “Wait up! Hold up! Shut up! Momma, clean up! Let me stay up!” Parents of
                        course are just the
                        opposite. Everything is down. “Just calm down! Slow down! Calm down here! Sit down. Put that down!” So again this curiosity, this looking up, this opening up is opposed to closing down that kids have. This notion. This is
                        what I hope will happen
                        in this class. The one real objective of education is to leave a man in the condition of continually asking questions.</p>

                    <p> 所以下面讲讲John Carter所作的纵向研究。John
                      Carter，河对面的商学院的领导管理学教授，1972年来到哈佛，做了老师并开始关注哈佛的课程。从1973年起一直关注了20年MBA课程，他想尽可能收集所有关于这门课的信息。20年后，90年代初当这个研究结束时，他发现这些学生都极其成功，以前的学生都极其成功，学生们都极其成功，非常有钱，有很大的影响力，不论是在组织上，还是社会上。他们都做得极其好，但是在这群极其成功的哈佛MBA里，他发现有一小部分人是格外成功的，比其它人要更成功。无论是在收入上，还是在影响力上，抑或是在总体生活质量上，格外的成功，他想弄明白其中的原因。这一小部分人和其他人有何区别，其他人也非常成功，但没有那一小组人那么成功。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> So here is a longitudinal study that was done by John Carter. John Carter, professor of leadership management of the business school across the river, came to Harvard in 1972, joined the faculty and started to follow
                        Harvard class, MBA class
                        of 1973 and followed them through 20 years. And what he was interested in was to find all the information he could about this class. What he found 20 years later, early 90s when this study ended was these students were
                        extremely successful, Or
                        ex-students were extremely successful, students were extremely successful, very wealthy, having a lot of impact, whether it’s on the organizations, on the community. They did extremely well. But within the large group of
                        highly successful
                        Harvard MBAs, he found a small group that was extraordinarily successful, more successful than the rest of group, whether in terms of income, whether in terms of impact, whether in terms of overall quality of life.
                        Extraordinarily successful.
                        What he wanted to identify was why– what distinguishes this small group from the rest of the pack: very successful, but not quite as successful as that small group. And he found only two things. It was not their IQs that made
                        no difference
                        whatsoever to their long-term success.</p>

                    <p>
                      他只找出了两件事，不是他们的智商，智商对导致他们长期成功的因素没有影响。不是他们在念MBA之前的出身，他们做的事和这一点关系都没有，只有两件事会决定谁会成为格外成功的人，和其余的人上有关系，第一是那部分人真的相信自己，他们认为自己能做好，他们有目的，他们有动力，我们会在下一次课讲到自我实现的预言，他们认为“我会做到，我会成功”，这是第一件事，自信，他发现的第二件事是，这部分人，一直在问问题，一直问问题，最初是问他们的老板，后来是问他们的雇员，他们的搭档、孩子、父母、朋友，他们一直在问问题，他们一直处于好奇的状态，一直在寻找，有开放的心态，想要更加了解世界，他们没有说“我现在有了MBA学位，就行了，我知道的够多了”。他们是终身学习者，</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>It was not where they came from, pre-MBA, what they did had nothing to do with it. Two and two things along mattered in terms of determining who will be the extraordinarily successful and the rest: the first thing was the
                        extraordinarily
                        successful groups really believe in themselves. They thought they could do well. They were driven. They were motivated. And we’ll talk about it in future lecture as belief in self-fulfilling prophecies. They thought “I’m
                        going to make it. I’m
                        going to succeed.” That’s the first thing. The sense of the confidence. The second thing that he found was this group, they were always asking questions, –always asking questions, initially of their boss, later of their
                        employees, of their
                        partners, children, parents, friends. They were always asking question. They were always at the state of curiosity. Always looking up, opening up, wanting to understand the world the more. They didn’t say “Now I have my MBA.
                        That’s it. I know
                        enough. “ They were life-long learners. They were always asking questions. These two distinguishing characteristics account for the difference between the extraordinarily successful and those who were successful.</p>

                      他们一直在问问题，这两个区别性的特质，导致了格外成功和成功的人之间的差别，那个指引了我的问题，不论是写书，还是开设这门课程，还是被我所称的“问题的问题”。就是“我们如何能帮助自己和他人，个人，群体和社会变得更幸福？”。注意这不是关于帮助我们自己和他人变得幸福，而是关于变得更幸福，为什么？因为很多人问我，“那么Tal，你幸福吗？”。我真的不能回答那个问题，我不知道那是什么意思，我如何判断自己是否幸福？是和别人比较？是不是存在一个点，超过之后就变幸福了？幸福不是二进制的非此即彼，0或1，要么幸福要么不幸福，幸福存在于一个连续统一体。所以我对这个问题的回答，“我幸福吗？”，我今天是否比我15年前刚开始关注追求幸福时更幸福。</p>

                        ourselves and
                        others, individuals, communities and society become happier?” Note that it is not about helping ourselves and others become happy. It is about becoming happier. Why? Because many people ask me, “So Tal, are you happy?” And I
                        can’t really answer
                        that question. I don’t know what it means. How do I determine whether or not I am happy? Is it compared to someone else? Is there a certain point beyond which I become happy? Happiness is not a binary either-or, zero-one–
                        either I’m happy or I’m
                        unhappy. Happiness resides on a continuum. So my answer to this question– “am I happy?” is today I’m happier than I was 15 years ago when I started focusing on this pursuit.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      15年后我当然希望自己能比今天幸福，幸福是终身的追求，希望本课程是这种追求的一部分。但只是一部分，你们不会在课结束时幸福，希望你们能比现在幸福。因为很多人坐在这听有关自尊的讲座时，比如，或者当我们明确地讨论幸福时，他们说，“等等，我的自尊心强吗？”，他们自己想到，“我的自尊是较强的还是较弱的？”，这也是没有意义。无法回答的问题是“我如何能提高我的自尊，我健康的自尊，而当然不是自恋？，我怎样才能变得幸福？”。那是一个重要的问题，这是问题的问题，本课程不是一个积极心理学的概论。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> 15 years from now I certainly hope to be happier than I am today. Happiness is lifelong pursuit. Hopefully this class is part of that pursuit, but just part. You’ll not be happy at the end of class. Hopefully you’ll be
                        happier. Cos many people
                        sit here during the lectures on self-esteem, for example, or when we talk explicitly about happiness, they say, “Wait. Do I have self-esteem?”– Thinking to themselves. “Do I have high self-esteem or low self-esteem?”
                        Irrelevant. Impossible to
                        answer also. The question is “how can I improve my self-esteem, my healthy self-esteem, not narcissism of course? How can I become happier?” That’s an important question. And this is the question of questions. This class is
                        not a survey of
                        positive psychology.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      如果你想要关于积极心理学的概论，我可以推荐一些很不错的课本，Lopez或是Peterson的书，很不错的课本。还有一本积极心理学手册，一本很厚的书，里面有这个领域里大多数你想知道的内容，你也可以用它自卫，自卫非常管用。但是本很棒的书，写得非常好，让人很容易理解积极心理学，但这里讲的不是那些，不是积极心理学概论，而是对“问题中的问题”的选择性探索。从那个角度讲，它是折衷的，我的背景是心理学和哲学，我学了组织行为学，我做过几年商业顾问，仍然还做一些这方面的工作，我在教育领域工作过，在教育领域内做过很多工作，我从所有这些领域中吸取内容。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> If you want a survey on positive psychology, I can recommend some excellent textbooks whether it’s by Lopez (Shane J. Lopez) or by Peterson (Chris Peterson). Great textbooks. There is also The Handbook of Positive
                        Psychology which is a huge
                        book with most what you want to know about this field. You can also use it in self-defense. Very useful in that respect. But a wonderful book, very well-written, very accessible in the spirit of positive psychology. But this
                        is not that. This is
                        not a survey of positive psychology. What it is is a selective exploration of the question of the questions. In that way, it is eclectic. My background is in psychology and philosophy. I studies organizational behavior. I
                        worked as a consultant
                        in business for a few years. Still do some work there. I worked in the field of education, doing a lot of work in field of education. And I take from all these areas.</p>

                    <p>
                      我还不只是从积极心理学中吸取内容，我把临床心理学的内容融入这个课程中，我融入了认知心理学。社会心理学等等内容，这是一个折衷的课程，因为我的问题，我的引导性问题是“什么会对幸福有贡献？”，如果我认为精神病理学的内容能对我们的幸福有贡献，我会吸取并利用之，而如果一些有关组织行为学的咨询领域的东西有用，那也会成为本课程的一部分，只要能在一个学期内讲完，所以本课程是折衷的，本课程不是跨文化交流，我会引进一些东方思想的观点。我在亚洲住过几年，我在那工作，持续研究东方哲学和心理学，但我的专业主要是在西方心理学上，而课程的重点将会是西方心理学，但是那并不意味着，积极心理学不适用于世界上其他地方的人。最近有一场高资历科学家之间的会议，来自西方的心理学家，像Paul
                      Ekman和Richard Davidson。这些在心理学领域内最重要的人物，和吹喇叭那个还有他的一些僧侣进行会谈。</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> my question, my guiding question was “what would contribute to happiness?” And if something within psychopathology I thought could contribute to our wellbeing, I took that and used that. And if something from the field of
                        consulting in
                        organizational behavior could contribute, that became part of the class, as much as I could fit in of course in one semester. So the class is eclectic. The class is not cross-cultural. I will bring in ideas from eastern
                        thoughts. I lived in Asia
                        for a few years. I worked there. Studied and continue to study the eastern philosophies and psychologies. But my train primarily is in western psychology. And the focus of the class will be that. However that doesn’t mean
                        that positive
                        psychology doesn’t apply to people from different places in the world. There was recently a meeting between senior scientists, psychologists from the west, people like Paul Ekman, Richard Davidson- some of the most important
                        minds in the field
                        of psychology meeting with the Dalai Lama and some of his monks.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>他们谈论了心理学的未来研究，还有如何研究冥想等等。而他们谈论较多的话题之一就是文化差异，当提到这个问题时，吹喇叭那个突然好像很不舒服，当记录整个会议的Daniel Goleman。会议是在印度开的，问他怎么了，吹喇叭那个说他不是因为谈到并强调文化差异而不舒服，对吹喇叭那个你可以有很多评价。但你不能说他在文化方面不敏感，他可以说是还在世的最敏感的人之一。<strong>然而他说，我们对文化差异的关注太多了，他补充道不是因为没有文化差异，当然有而且很重要，但文化共同性要比差异多，而我们不应该无视这些共同性。</strong></p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>They were talking about the future of psychology, about the research, and how can you research meditation and so on. And one of the things they were talking a lot about is the cultural differences. And when that came up, the
                        Dalai Lama suddenly
                        seemed uneasy. And when Daniel Goleman who was writing about this whole event and it was held in India asked him what’s wrong, Dalai Lama said that he was not comfortable with talking and emphasizing so much cultural
                        differences. You can say
                        many things about Dalai Lama. One thing you cannot say about him is that he’s culturally insensitive, arguably one of the most sensitive people alive. And yet he said we are focusing too much on cultural differences and he
                        added not because
                        there are no cultural differences. Of course there are and they are important. But there are many more similarities than differences. And we shouldn’t ignore those similarities.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> Daniel
                      Goleman如此评价吹喇叭那个，“我们有点惊讶于吹喇叭那个这种表面上的，对文化差异概念的抵触”，所以我想介绍这些观点。但是首先，因为这不是我的专业，研究文化差异的人会比我做得更好，其次，因为我所希望研究的是普遍事物，不同文化中普遍的东西，所以我们会在这方面进行研究。不只是这样，我们的讨论比这部分心理学更具体，我们将会研究你们自己，我们会如此具体，为什么？当我开这门课程时，我自己没想过，“好的，我需要介绍些什么东西，以便能取悦课程的参与者，这些学生呢？”。
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Daniel Goleman about the Dalai Lama, “We were a little bit surprised by the Dalai Lama’s seeming resistance to the notion of cultural differences. So I am willing to introduce these ideas but A, because it’s not my training
                        and people who are
                        focusing on cultural differences will do a much better job than I do; and second, because what I hope to look into is the universal, things are common across cultures. So we’ll study research in this area. But even more than
                        that, we’ll become
                        even more particular than just talking about psychology in this part of the world. We’ll study yourselves. We are going to go that particular. Now why? When I put this class together, I didn’t think to myself, “Ok, so what
                        are the things that I
                        need to introduce in order to please the participants in the class, the students?”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>那不是我所想的，我所想的是&gt; “如果我是个本科生，会想上什么课？，如果我坐在这，什么能让我更幸福？”。换言之，从我的观点，从非常个人的观点出发，在我们的课上，我会鼓励你们，有大量的样本，但最主要的，我会鼓励你们去看自己的内心，去研究自己。无论是通过两周后开始的每周一次的课后论文，还是你们最后的演示作业，你们不用做演示但要写出来，一个关于你最感兴趣的话题或者对你来说最重要的话题的演示，还是关于如何能把这些观点应用于我的生活。 </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>That’s not what I thought. What I thought about was “what was the class that I would have wanted to take as an undergraduate here? What would help me become happier if I were sitting there?” In other words, thinking from my
                        perspective from
                        very personal perspective. In this class I am going to encourage you. about large sample sizes. But I’m going to encourage you more than anything to look inside yourselves. To study yourselves. Whether it’s through response
                        papers that will be
                        due weekly starting in 2 weeks; whether it’s in your final project that will be a presentation that you won’t have to give but you’ll have to write out– a presentation about your favorite topic or the topic that matters most
                        to you; whether it’s
                        in sections that you’ll be talking about how can I apply these ideas to my life.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>“练习时间”是关于如何接受和利用一些观点，是关于研究我们自己，因为正如Carl
                      Rogers所说，“越是个人的东西越普遍”，“越是个人的东西越普遍”、正如Maslow所补充，“我们必须记住对一个人深层本性的认识，同时也是对普遍人类本性的认识”、当我们更了解自己时，当我们认识到自己时，我们就更能认识他人。事实上，从许多方面说这是有益移情的来源，有些研究表明了解自己的人，研究自己的人，反思自己的人，对别人做出过分的行为，不道德的行为会相对较少，那种比如说种族歧视的行为，在一定程度上这是反直觉的，等等，你难道不要首先研究别人，才能对别人更敏感吗？”。是的，那也需要，不过还不够，研究我们自己也很重要，因为当我们看到自己的深层本性时，我们看到的是部分普遍的本性，我们所有人之间的共性，不管我们来自哪里。
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>The time-ins are about thinking about how can I take in the ideas and use them. It’s about studying ourselves. Because as Carl Rogers says, “What is most personal is most general.” “What is most personal is most general.”
                        And as Maslow adds,
                        “We must remember that knowledge of one’s own deep nature is also simultaneously knowledge of human nature in general.” When we understand ourselves better, when we identify ourselves, we are better able to identify with
                        others. In fact, this is
                        in many ways the source of empathy, of the healthy empathy. And there are some studies showing that people who know themselves, who study themselves, who are self-reflective, display less egregious behavior, less immoral
                        behavior toward others.
                        Behavior that would fall under say, racism. And it’s counter-intuitive to some extent. “Wait. Don’t you first need to study the other so that you can be more sensitive to others?” Yes, that too. But it’s not enough. It is
                        important to also study
                        ourselves, because when we see our deep nature, what we encounter there is part of the universal nature, the similarities among us all, regardless of where we are from.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> 而这就是吹喇叭那个所说的，不是阻止跨文化研究，去做吧，很重要，但同时，不要忽视自己，不要忽视我们每一个人身上的普遍性。C.S.
                      Lewis说，“整个宇宙中有且只有一件，我们知道我们可以从外部观察中学习到的事，那就是我们自己，我们有，可以说是，内在的信息，我们是知道的”。当我们研究自己时当然会有偏颇，这就是为什么只研究自己是不够的，要克服这个问题，把学术工作，研究他人融入进去很重要，那就是为什么我们除了探究我们的内心外，也会做一些研究或调查研究，两者并重。我们不应该，只是因为会有潜在的偏颇和错误，这并不意味着我们要因噎废食，停止探究自己，所以我们会，更准确地说是你们会这样做，比学校里的其他课程做得要多。
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>And this was what Dalai Lama was talking about: not stop cross-cultural. Do it.Important. But at the same time, not ignore the self. Not ignore the universal within each one of us. C.S. Lewis, “There is one thing and only
                        one in the whole
                        universe which we know about that we could learn from external observation. That one thing is ourselves. We have, so to speak, inside information; we are in the know.” Now there are of course biases when we study ourselves
                        which is why it’s not
                        enough to just study the self. It’s important to counter it, to add to it, academic work, studying others. That’s why we’ll do some research or study research as well as do some search– searching inside us. Both are
                        important. We shouldn’t, just
                        because there are biases and mistakes that potentially can be made, it doesn’t mean we need to throw out the baby with the bath water and stop studying ourselves. So we’ll do that or rather you’ll do that probably more than
                        any other class on
                        campus. </p>

                    <p>Homles这里的意思是他关心的不只是简单性，简单的，随意的，难以预料的想法，而他所关心的是之后的简单性，我们深思了这个观点。在我们吸收了它之后，在我们考虑过它之后，那些我们所研究的观点，而如果与复杂性相反，我们能看出简单性和常识，那就很好，那是他所感兴趣的，那也是我们整个学期要讨论的。积极心理学研究者所感兴趣的，与复杂性相对的简单性，这两种简单性之间有很大的区别，尽管乍看起来，他们有时也许是相似的。本课程需要的是一种非常不同的努力，与别的课程非常不同的努力，再一次它不需要你像55号课和10A号英语课那样的努力。它所需要的努力是一种应用的努力，努力把它应用到你的生活里，努力把行为的实际改变带入你的生活，在我们开始讲本课程的一些细节比如教学大纲之前。我想先讲一个关于Peter，Drucker的故事。Peter
                      Drucker，我之前引用过他的话，是现代管理学研究之父。Peter，Drucker享年94岁，是几年前过世的，在他生命的最后当他头脑还百分百清醒时，活动和参加组织活动对他来说更加困难了，于是他邀请想咨询他问题的人，想跟他学习的人来他家。 </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>What Holmes means here is that he doesn’t care about just simplicity, easy, off-the-cuff, whimsical ideas. What he does care about though is the simplicity that comes after. We have chewed the idea, after we have digested
                        it, after we have
                        thought about it. Ideas that have been worked on. And if on the other side of complexity we can read simplicity and common sense, that’s great. That’s what he’s interested in. That is also positive psychology researchers that
                        we’ll discuss
                        throughout the semester are interested in. The simplicity on the other side of complexity. And there is a very big difference between these two simplicities, even though on the face of it, they may at times look similar. What
                        this class requires
                        is a very different kind of effort. A very different kind of effort to other class. Again it doesn’t require the effort that you’ll need in 55 or in English 10A. The kind of effort that it does require is the effort of
                        application, of applying
                        into your life, of introducing behavioral actual change to your life. And before we go into some of the technicalities of the class such as the syllabus, I want to end with a story about Peter Drucker. Peter Drucker, who I
                        quoted earlier, father
                        of study of management in modern times. Peter Drucker lived to the grand old age of 94, passed away just a couple of years ago. Toward the end of his life while he was still 100% lucid, it was more difficult for him to be
                        mobile and to go into
                        organizations. So what he did was invite people who wanted consulting from him, wanted to learn from him to come to his home. And he had Presidents, Premier Ministers of countries.</p>

                    <p>有国家总统、总理、财富500强公司的CEO和他一起过周末，而在星期五，每一次聚会都是这样开始的，对每一个世界级领袖，无论是商界的，非盈利机构的，还是政界的，他都会对他们说如下的一番话，“星期一我不想听到你们说这有多美好”，意思是这个周末有多美好，“星期一我想听到你们跟我说，你们做了些什么改变”。在这学期结束后或者在这个讲座结束后，如果你们喜欢它，务必告诉我你们喜欢，你们获得了乐趣，但更重要的是你们所做的改变是什么，这对你们的生活有怎样的影响。而那需要我们的努力，我们将用一周的时间讲改变，和积极心理学一点直接的关系也没有，只是讲改变，因为改变是那么难，因为我们知道大多数组织上的改变都失败了。因为我们知道更多的个人改变失败了，除非我们引入行为上的改变的同时引入认知上和情绪上的改变，影响和认知还不够，还必须有行为，你所做的改变，经常用不同的方式做事需要勇气。

                        He would say to
                        them the following, “on Monday I don’t want you to call me up and tell me how wonderful it was, “– meaning how wonderful the weekend was, “on Monday I want you to call me up and tell me what you are doing differently.” At the

                        So if you really want class to make a difference in your life, it’s up to you. I’m going to introduce to you the material. I’m going to introduce to you this wonderful new field of positive psychology. what is up to you is to
                        then take it and
                        apply it. I want to talk a little about the syllabus and the requirements. And I’ll give you a little time for questions. But before I do that, I would also like to welcome– I know that some of you are watching this from
                        home, to the extension
                        school students, it’s wonderful to have you here. Do come and visit once a while. And you’ll be working with obviously part of this class, but also with Deb Levy who is the, they had teaching fellow for the extension school.</p>

                    <p>Sean Achor是文理&gt;
                      学院的助教，我想请他来说几句话，向你们做个自我介绍，而你们会被介绍给我们的其他助教。我们今年有支很棒的团队。这就是Sean，嘿，上午好，能听到我吗？现在能听得到吗？很好，能回来再次为积极心理学做助教非常荣幸，Tal太谦虚了，很荣幸他能给我们上课，他还把家搬来了，把家从以色列搬到这一整个学期，包括他的妻子和他的两个孩子，只是为了能和我们一起教这门课。对我们来说能和他们一起共事是个极好的机会，我真的很激动，上一次我们教这门课时，我们做了一个调查，看看坐在这上课的都是什么类型的人，他们就像你们一样，看看为什么你们会上这门课。因为我们得到的关于这门课的评价常常是，为什么哈佛的学生会不幸福？他们有什么可不快乐的？他们认为每个上这门课的人会上这门课，是因为他们已经很幸福了，他们想研究自己到底有多棒，他们想学一些能明白地告诉室友他们得意的东西，但是结果是去年有超过三分之一的人。选这门课是因为他们感觉抑郁，他们想学习积极心理学，还有三分之一是因为他们想学会乐观，另外三分之一的原因则完全不同。

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>They had teaching fellow for the FAS class is Sean Achor and I’d like just to invite him for just a few words, just to introduce himself to you. And you’ll be introduced to other TFs we have. We have an amazing team this
                        year. This is Sean.
                        Sean:Hey good morning. Can you guys hear me? Can you hear me now? Great. This is absolutely honored to be back teaching positive psychology again. Tal is too humble. This is not only extraordinary that he is sharing his time
                        with us, but he’s
                        actually moved here back, moved his family back from Israel for the entire semester,his wife and his two little children just so he can teach this class with us. And this is absolutely an extraordinary opportunity for us to
                        share this moment
                        with them. And I’m really excited about it. Last time we taught this class, we did a survey to find out what type of people were sitting in this room– they are just like yourselves– and find out why you’ll be taking this
                        class. Coz the comment
                        that we get so often about this class is why would Harvard students possibly be unhappy? what do they have to be unhappy about? They thought everyone who’d be taking this class would be taking it because they are already
                        really happy and they
                        want to study about how amazing they are. And they’d like to learn things that they can tell the roommates so clearly that (?) themselves. But it turns out actually over a third of people who took this class last year took
                        the class because they
                        felt depressed. And they were trying to learn about the research about positive psychology. And another third because they wanted to learn about optimism. Another third did it for completely different reasons.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>我想，今年还有三分之一的人选这门课是因为Tal上了Jon Stewart的Daily
                      Show，我很喜欢这门课，Tal要告诉你们的教学大纲是…其实我们了解你们的一些其他事，你不知不知道选了积极心理学的人中，有75%的人是俱乐部的干部，35%是俱乐部的高层干部，这意味着。你认为哈佛有大约2000个俱乐部，你在一个只有3个人的俱乐部里，又恰好是主席，我们了解到你们不快乐的其他原因，我们了解到上积极心理学课的人，在4年里恋爱次数的平均数在0到1之间，0到1之间，不！我不信，不要走。但那是在上积极心理学课之前，是在上课之前，我们之后会调查一下你们，性伴侣数目的平均数是在0到0.5之间，我实在不知道0.5个性伴侣是什么。这门课程将会很棒，它过去就很棒，而且我们有一个很出色的教学团队，很大的教学团队。
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>I think. Additional third this year did it because Tal was on the Jon Stewart Daily Show. I am absolutely thrilled about this class. The syllabus which Tal is about to tell you about is.. Actually we learned a couple of
                        other things about you
                        guys. Did you know that of people who take positive psychology, 75% of you are officers of club, 35% of you are the highest ranking officers of club, which means that you think there are about 2000 clubs at Harvard, you are
                        in club of three, and
                        you happen to be the president. We learned other reasons why you are not happy. we learned that the average number of romantic relationships for people to take positive psychology in 4 years is between zero and one. Zero and
                        one. (Tal: No! I
                        don’t believe it.) Don’t leave. - But that was before taking positive psychology class.\N- That was before taking the class. We are going to test you afterwards. The average number of sexual partners is between zero and .5. I
                        have no idea what
                        .5 sexual partners is. This class is going to be amazing. It was amazing in the past and Tal we actually have extraordinary teaching staff here with us. It’s a large teaching staff.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      Tal实际上已经给我们布置了作业，所以老师们不仅要学你们学的那些材料，和你们讨论专业的内容，还要学习如何成为更好的老师。他给了我们要读的书，他事实上给我们布置了任务，从那个意义上说这是个很特别的课程。至于教学大纲，网上会有，Tal说现在我们决定要环保，所以这门课程中不能使用树木制品，除了这个木制的大礼堂，我们下周会在网上分组。所以我们星期三会知道有多少分组，下个周末我们会做分组任务，给你们的周转时间就非常少了，如果需要的话，你们可以在周一换组，虽然我不希望你们改，分组会在下一个星期开始，非常谢谢，如果还有什么问题，给我发邮件。
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>And Tal has actually already given us home works so the teachers are going to be learning not only the material you are doing and talk you about which the experts (?), but learning how to be better teachers. He’s given us
                        books to read. He’s
                        actually given us assignment. It’s a big extraordinary class in that sense. In terms of the syllabus, it’s going to be online. Tal just described now we’ve decided to go green, so no trees are in making of this class except
                        the large auditorium
                        made of wood. Sections– we are going to try sections online next weekend. So we are going to get the numbers on Wednesday. On following weekend we will be doing sectioning that gives you a very short of turnaround time. But
                        that way you can give
                        me Monday to change your section if you need to, which I hope you won’t. And sections will start the following week. Thank you very much. If you have any questions, send me an email.</p>

                    <p>
                      好的，那么…我想我不需要跟你们解释，为什么这学期有一节课不是我教而是Sean教的，而那节是讲幽默的，你们自己想想为什么。我确实认为如果你想教什么你就必须擅长，教学大纲，本课程，是向你介绍我关于这门课程的想法的，是我所谓的，整体的课程。就是指纵向的整体和横向的整体，纵向意味着每一节课都和下一节课有关系，和整个学期内的每一节课都有关系，呈一个螺旋状。所以我们下周所讲的内容，我们将在第7课，第17课和第24课里，再回顾一遍，所有内容在一个更高的水平上呈螺旋状互相联系。换言之，会带来深刻的理解和我所希望的对材料的吸收，所以是纵向相互联系的，同样也是横向相互联系的。就是说课程中的每一部分都强调并影响另一部分。
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Ok, so… I think I don’t need to explain to you why there is one lecture in the semester that I don’t teach and Sean will teach it. And that is the lecture on humor. Figure out why yourselves. I do think you’ll have to walk
                        and talk if you are
                        teaching something. The syllabus. The class, is to introduce you to my thinking about the class, is what I call it, integrated class. What that means is that integrated vertically as well as horizontally. Vertically means
                        that every class
                        connected to the next class is connected to every class throughout the semester around a spiral. So what we’ll talk about next week, we’ll revisit it again in lesson 7, lesson 17 and lesson 24. Everything is interconnected on
                        the higher level on
                        a spiral– in other words will lead to deep understanding and hopefully assimilation of the material. So it’s vertically interconnected. It’s also horizontally interconnected. That means every part of the class reinforces and
                        influences the other
                        part.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> 上课还不够，你们在分组&gt;
                      作业里面将收获更多，分组作业是强制的。你们要在你们的分组里做大量，和你的课后论文相关的工作，许多学生说这是本课程最重要的一部分。因为这样你们才有了练习时间，这是你真正开始凿掉的时候，和期末的大作业有很大的关系，期末作业是一个演示稿，你们不用真的做演示，但要向几个朋友演示以获得反馈。那部分不计分，期末作业是以期末论文计分的。但只是你们交上来的，你们提交的那份，为什么写期末论文，是因为像演示那样的最好的方式，因为最好的学习方式是教，你们将把这些材料教给别人，任何在你的陈述中你所感兴趣的内容。那么阅读，非常有关系，会把你们带到理解和吸收的另一个水平高度，在我讲完之前有问题吗？你们有什么要问的吗？好了，那就让我说，最后一秒钟结束语，对于能回到这里我感到非常激动，我的家人对于回到这里也很激动。期望能和你们共度一个有意义的，愉快的，令人享受的和更加幸福的学期，谢谢！</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>The lectures, not enough, you’ll get a lot more in sections. Sections are mandatory. You’ll do a lot of work in your sections, very much related to your response papers that many student claim the most important part of the
                        class. Because
                        that’s where you get the time-in. That’s when you really get to chip away. Very much connected to the final project. The final project is a presentation that you’ll write out. You don’t actually give it but give it to a
                        couple of friends just to
                        get feedback. Not graded on that part. The final project is graded as a final paper, but just what you hand in, what you submit. And the reason why there is a final paper because the best way which is like a presentation,
                        because the best way to
                        learn is to teach. And you’ll be teaching these materials to other people – any material that you are interested in your presentation. So the readings, very much connected and take you to the next level of understanding and
                        assimilation. So any
                        questions before I finish up? Any question from you? Alright. So let me just say– one second finishing words. I am very excited to be back here. My families are very excited to be back here. Looking forward to a meaningful,
                        pleasurable,
                        enjoyable and happier semester with you. Thank you.</p>
